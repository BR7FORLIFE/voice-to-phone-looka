What is cloud-based call center software?

Cloud-based call center software is a solution installed and run on servers hosted in a service provider's data center. This solution, which uses [IP telephony](https://www.voicetophone.com/que-es-la-telefonia-ip-como-funciona/es), allows call center agents to work from anywhere with an internet connection and enables administrators to monitor team performance in real time. Additionally, the cloud provides scalability and flexibility to adapt to your company's changing needs.
