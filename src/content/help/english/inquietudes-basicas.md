<summary>What is IP telephony?</summary>

What is IP telephony?

It is a telephone service that uses the VoIP protocol to make or receive calls at very low cost regardless of location. Also called Voice over IP, it converts the voice signal into data packets over the internet instead of sending it analogically as traditional telephony does.

How to pay for my services?

Depending on the plan or service purchased, you must top up your account with the amount specified in the agreement.

We accept payments via PayPal, Bancolombia, Davivienda, or Baloto.

Note: Accounts for virtual numbers such as PBX and Call Center have scheduled automatic monthly payments and must have sufficient balance before the number's renewal date to deduct the monthly fee.

</details>

<summary>Do balances expire?</summary>

Do balances expire?

Retail and callshop customer balances expire after 3 months.

</details>

<details id="inquietudes-basicas-q-7-necesito-internet">
<summary>Do I need internet?</summary>

Do I need internet?

Yes. As a cloud-based technology, a broadband internet connection, 3G, or 4G is required depending on whether the device is a VoIP phone, ATA, PC, or a calling app on a smartphone.

However, for some services like call forwarding for virtual numbers, an internet connection is not required.

</details>

<details id="inquietudes-basicas-q-8-como-es-la-calidad-de-las-llamadas">
<summary>How is call quality?</summary>

How is call quality?

Internal calls within the Voice to Phone network are high definition, with excellent audio and clear voice.

We work daily to provide the best service quality using the latest technologies.

For external calls, we interconnect with providers from different countries that offer varying qualities, but we always strive to maintain a good cost-quality ratio.

Note: Another factor to consider is the quality and availability of the customer's internet service, as this also affects call quality.

Do I need to sign a contract?
