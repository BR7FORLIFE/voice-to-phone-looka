What do I get with a SIP trunk service for my company?

With a SIP trunk service you get a link that connects our telephony service to your PBX, telephone system, or call center to make or receive calls via SIP at low cost, with the number of simultaneous channels required.

Our connection can be authenticated by IP address or by username and password if you do not have a fixed IP.

Yes. To receive calls, you can associate one or several [virtual numbers](https://www.voicetophone.com/numero-virtual/es) (DIDs), including numbers from different destinations on the same outbound trunk. Both channels (incoming and outgoing) will be used independently on the same trunk.

The cost of each virtual number you want to associate can be reviewed [here](https://www.voicetophone.com/rates/5/es).
