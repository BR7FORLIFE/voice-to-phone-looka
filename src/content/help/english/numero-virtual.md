Yes. You can try our service for several days, and to give you a real reference of operation we provide virtual numbers from the USA and Colombia.

No. Calls received on your DID number can be forwarded and answered on any landline or mobile number, and an internet connection is not required.

However, if you want to receive calls on a softphone for PC or mobile devices, an internet connection is necessary, as well as when receiving directly on IP phones or ATA devices.
