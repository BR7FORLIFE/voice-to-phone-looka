## Boost your sales and customer service

Transform your Contact Center operation with our cloud software suite. VoiceToPhone provides advanced tools designed to reduce wait times, increase contact rates, and simplify supervision of your teams—whether they work in-office or remotely.

### Intelligent Dialers

Forget manual dialing. Our algorithms optimize agent time so they focus only on speaking with real customers.

- **Predictive Dialer:** The system launches multiple calls simultaneously based on connection statistics. It filters busy tones, voicemails and invalid numbers, connecting the agent only when a human answers—ideal for high-volume campaigns.
- **Progressive Dialer:** Automatically places the call when an agent becomes available, ensuring a steady workflow without the "dead time" of manual dialing.
- **Preview Dialer:** Lets the agent review the customer's record and details before initiating the call—great for consultative sales or personalized collections.

### Real-time Management and Supervision

Stay in full control of your operation with our Call Center Software:

1. **Live Monitoring:** View agent statuses (available, on call, on break) and queue metrics in real time.
2. **Call Recording:** Secure storage of interactions for quality control and audits.
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Detailed reports on productivity, call duration and campaign effectiveness to support data-driven decisions.

### Automation and Telemarketing

Reach thousands of customers in minutes with our mass-delivery tools:

- **Mass Voice Messages (Blaster):** Send prerecorded notifications to large databases.
- **SMS Marketing:** Text campaigns with high open rates.
- **CRM Integration:** Connect call flows to your customer database for unified management.
